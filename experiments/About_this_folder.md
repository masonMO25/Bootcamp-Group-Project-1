# About the Experiments Folder

During the process of development, it was sometimes helpful to try some things out to see if they would work.

To tidy up this project, I (Jason Charney) have decided to move some of that stuff into its own folder.

These things were used to develop the functionality that was used in the main project such as using Leaflet to add maps to our project and Crypto-JS to write a secure method to encrypt the Yelp API key.

Not all of the experiements were successful. We had thought about putting the search results on a separate page in a file called search.html, but once we realized we could still develop a Single Page Application (SPA), there was no need to use it. But the work that went into writing it makes it worthy of archiving.

In the future, I'd like to add this directory to act as a proving grounds to any projects and I would hope that my team mates would follow this example such as to not clutter up the project like I had.

> Note: I didn't adjust the CSS or JS files yet in these files yet. When that is done, I'll remove this notice.
